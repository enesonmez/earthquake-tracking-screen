# Earthquake Tracking Screen

![Earthquake Tracking Screen](/assets/images/screenshot.png)

It was created to observe the earthquakes in the world on an hourly, daily, and weekly basis. It shows the location, magnitude and time of the earthquake. [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson_detail.php) was used to retrieve earthquake information. (Dünyada yaşanan depremleri saatlik, günlük, ve haftalık olarak gözlemlemek için oluşturulmuştur. Depremin meydana geldiği yeri, büyüklüğü ve zamanı göstermektedir. Deprem bilgilerini çekmek için [USGS Earthquake API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson_detail.php)'ı kullanılmıştır.)
